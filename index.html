      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hanging out with my wife and our cat, and also playing soccer. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Having my own tech company would be nice, but I would settle for working at Tesla, Apple or Google. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always had a love for technology and the internet. Until recently though I had not considered makinh a career out of it. I feel silly for waiting until now to get started, but I feel like my motivation now is stronger than ever. I would like to make positive changes to the way we interact with the internet for the future.  </p>
